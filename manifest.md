This manifesto describes everything concerning the **principles** of the **teamâ€™s work**.

In the company, all developers are **versatile units** who can replace each other on projects.
This company specializes in **developing web applications**.

## Development Rules

All developers are **Fullstack** developers. All projects are written in **TypeScript** using the following **libraries and frameworks**:

- Vue 3 (composition API);
- React;
- Next.js;
- Nuxt.js;
- Nest.js.

The **BEM approach should be used** for writing styles. BEM is not applicable if a UI framework or component libraries are used.
The following **UI frameworks or preprocessors** should be used:

- Tailwind;
- SASS (SCSS format);
- Component libraries.

Data validation is carried out using the **Zod** library. Using this library, input fields are validated. Data from the server is validated using **TypeScript types**.
All other libraries depend on the type of project and are chosen individually.

Also, **Prettier** and **ESLint** should be configured for each project. All projects should look **unified**. Basic Prettier settings will be provided in another [repository]().

When writing the **backend**, it is advisable to use **cloud data storage**. An example of such a database could be **Supabase**. **Prisma** is recommended as the ORM. **Tanstack Query** and **Axios** are used for communication with the database.

Maintaining **minimal documentation is mandatory**. Application testing is desirable but sometimes can be omitted (depending on the order and technical specifications).

Technologies that **cannot be used**:

- Bootstrap;
- jQuery;
- The list may be updated.

## Team Communication Rules

**Toxic communication is strictly not welcomed** in the team.
This means that no one should be **insulted**, **discussed**, etc. The personal **boundaries** of teammates (personal time, personal space, personal life, etc.) should **also be respected**.
In case of various unforeseen circumstances, it is necessary to inform the **PM** and **team lead**.
In general, follow the best practices of **Soft Skills**.
